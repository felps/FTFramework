<h3>Welcome to InteGrade Portal</h3>
<p>
The InteGrade project is multi-university initiative aimed at building a novel object-oriented Grid middleware that focuses on leveraging the idle computing power of commodity workstations such as PCs in shared laboratories, corporate employee workstations, and household PCs. Our goal is to allow organizations to use their existing computing infrastructure to perform useful computation, without requiring the purchase of additional hardware. Moreover, users who share the idle portion of their resources should have their quality of service preserved by the InteGrade middleware. InteGrade provides support for highly-coupled parallel applications, checkpointing, security, and an integrated development environment.
